## Installing the Katacoda-CLI

Katacoda-CLI can be installed via the Node Package Manager (npm). The CLI can be installed with the following command:

`npm install katacoda-cli --global`{{execute}}

This command tells npm to install the katacoda-cli globally instead of for the current directory only, hence the `--global` flag.
